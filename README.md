# Suspicious Face Detection : A Monitoring System

## Introduction

This project is based on the detection of suspicious behavior of a person analysing the facial aspects of the respective person. The project primarily focuses the implementation to be done as a lab monitoring system. The system would consist of the following features:
1. Detection of Face : _Identifying 'No Face' and 'Multiple Faces' detection scenarios_
2. Detection of Light Intensity : _possesses a threshold value_
3. Detection of Lip Movement : _recognition of speaking_
4. Detection of Head Orientation : _possesses a threshold angle of orientation_
5. Analysis of Facial Expressions 
6. Tracking of Eye

A warning system is implemented in this project to notify the officials about the detections so that immediate necessary actions could be taken. The detection details are sent to a remote server from which the details are rendered to a WebApp GUI to be viewed by the official.
