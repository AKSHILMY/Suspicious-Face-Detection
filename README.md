A warning system is implemented in this project to notify the officials about the detections so that immediate necessary actions could be taken. The detection details are sent from a desktop application to a remote server from which the details are rendered to a WebApp GUI to be viewed by the official. Important detection details are stored in a database.

## Basic Face Detection
The detection of the face is an essential feature for this monitoring system. Though this detection could serve as an attendance recording procedure at the intial stage of the monitoring process, the availability of the student through out the monitoring session is highly important. Also, the monitoring system ensures that the student solely does his work. Here is when the detection of multiple faces comes to play. <br>
